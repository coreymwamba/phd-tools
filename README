# PhD tools

This repo holds a number of scripts and methods that I have made over the course of my PhD to help me organise myself. Obviously they could be used for any larger writing project; but since my the project I was working on was a doctorate, the name of the repo reflects this.

##scope
The tools are for **Linux systems**, as Linux is the only operating system I use. I haven't tested it anywhere else, and am not able to do so. But some of this will still be useful.

The software I used:

1. [Conky][co]
2. [Libreoffice/Openoffice][lo]
3. [exiftool][ex]
4. A Git hosting service (like Github, Gitlab, &c.)

##setup
The original way I did was messy, and I found a way through trials and constant errors. This will be much more ordered.

##1. Set up a private Git repository (or some form of version control store)
a. Make a folder on you computer where your chapters/sections/media are going to be stored.
b. Sign up for an account on a Git hosting service
c. Make a private repo (these are free on both Github and Gitlab)
d. Follow instructions to link folder to Git repo
e. Give access to supervisory team/critical friends
